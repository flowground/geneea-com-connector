    "description": " AUTHENTICATION\nFor all calls, supply your API key. Sign up to obtain the key\n[https://www.geneea.com/pricing].\n\nOur API supports both unencrypted (HTTP) and encrypted (HTTPS) protocols.\nHowever, for security reasons, we strongly encourage using only the encrypted\nversion. \n\nThe API key should be supplied as either a request parameter user_key or in \nAuthorization header.\n\nAuthorization: user_key <YOUR_API_KEY>\n\nAPI OPERATIONS\nAll API operations can perform analysis on supplied raw text or on text\nextracted from a given URL. Optionally, one can supply additional information\nwhich can make the result more precise. An example of such information would be\nthe language of text or a particular text extractor for URL resources. \n\nThe supported types of analyses are:\n\n * lemmatization ⟶ Finds out lemmata (basic forms) of all the words in the\n   document. \n * correction ⟶ Performs correction (diacritization) on all the words in the\n   document. \n * topic detection ⟶ Determines a topic of the document, e.g. finance or sports. \n * sentiment analysis ⟶ Determines a sentiment of the document, i.e. how\n   positive or negative the document is. \n * named entity recognition ⟶ Finds named entities (like person, location, date\n   etc.) mentioned the the document. \n\nENCODING\nThe supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially\nimportant for non-english texts.\n\nRETURNED VALUES\nThe API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.\n\nIf any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range 4xx \n(client-side error) or 5xx (server-side error). In this situation, the body of\nthe response will contain information about the error in JSON format, with \nexception and message values. \n\nURL LIMITATIONS\nAll the requests are semantically GET. However, for longer texts, you may run\ninto issues with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a \nPOST request with all the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body. \n\nExample:\n\n\n        POST /s1/sentiment\n        Content-Type: application/json\n\n        {\"text\":\"There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out.\"}\n    \n\nThis is equivalent to GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...\n\nREQUEST LIMITATIONS\nThe API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests. The\nmaximum allowed size of any POST request body is 512 KiB. For request with a URL\nresource, the maximum allowed number of extracted characters from each such\nresource is 100,000. \n\nTERMS OF SERVICE\nBy using the API, you agree to our Terms of Service Agreement\n[https://www.geneea.com/terms.html]. \n\nMORE INFORMATION\n The Interpretor Public Documentation [https://help.geneea.com/index.html]",
